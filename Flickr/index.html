				<p>
				Flickr (pronounced "flicker") is an image hosting and video hosting website, 
				and web services suite that was created by Ludicorp in 2004 and acquired by Yahoo in 2005. 
				In addition to being a popular website for users to share and embed personal photographs, 
				and effectively an online community, the service is widely used by photo researchers and 
				by bloggers to host images that they embed in blogs and social media.
