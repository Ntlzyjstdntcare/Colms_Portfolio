You are in a tent with four of your friends while camping in the Ural Mountains. You hear a low growling outside. Do you (A) Look outside?(B) Stay as quiet as you can?
You carefully open the zip of the tent and peer outside. You find yourself face-to-face with a giant Yeti! You let out an involuntary yelp. The Yeti snarls and grabs the tent with its gnarled claw, yanking the pegs free of the ground. You run for your life but tumble down a scree slope and all goes black. When you wake, the sky is dark. There are no sounds coming from the direction of the camp. Do you (A) Climb up the steep slope towards your camp?(B)Head for the park ranger station over the brow of the next hill?
You keep deathly still. Suddenly, a huge Yeti tears the tent from the ground. One of your friends wakes with a start. The Yeti swipes at him, knocking his head clean off his shoulders. You're next. You are savagely torn to pieces. THE END! Your adventure Story is saved and output to results.txt. Thanks for playing, press A or B to exit.
You climb up the hill. The gradient is steep and the footing is treacherous, but after about half an hour you reach the top. You carefully approach the campsite. It is a mess, but at first glance there are no signs of any of your friends, dead or otherwise. There has been a snowfall, and it has covered the YetiÂ’s footprints. However, you see two separate sets of human footprints, leading in opposite directions. Do you(A) Follow the prints that lead up the trail, in the direction of a small hamlet that you know to be about 10km away?(B) Follow the prints that lead down the trail, back the way you came?
You begin to walk towards the ranger station. However, on cresting the hill, it becomes obvious that you are not where you thought you were. You had lost your bearings on being knocked unconscious, and now you are completely lost. You attempt to refind the trail, but after several fruitless hours you collapse from exhaustion, cracking your head on the ground. Your skull is fractured, and you die.

You walk up the trail following what you assume to be the footprints of one of your friends. After about half a mile the prints veer off the trail, and down into some woods. It is dark in the woods, and you soon lose the prints. You search for them for several hours, but eventually you succumb to exhaustion and collapse in the snow, and die.

You start walking back down the trail, in the direction from which your group came. However, after some time, a blizzard completely blinds you and soon you are trudging through snow at least two feet deep. Inevitably, you lose the trail. The snow has completely obscured a shallow ravine, into which you fall. You fracture your skull and die. THE END Your adventure Story is saved and output to results.txt.
